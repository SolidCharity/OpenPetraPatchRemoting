-PetraMultiStart
-===============
-PetraMultiStart is an application that starts many Clients on a single machine, running against the same Server, 
-and makes these Clients perform some actions, and then have them close after a specified time.
-
-This program is very useful in testing the stability of the PetraServerConsole application and for finding 
-concurrency issues that are otherwise very hard to test when the product is not used in a production environment!
-
--------   -------   
-WARNING   WARNING
--------   -------
-    As the program potentially launches many Clients, and may do so in a very short time frame, the computer where the
-    program is run can be RENDERED UNRESPONSIVE at times, esp. when the PetraServerConsole (and potentially PostgreSQL, 
-    too) are run on the same computer! Advice: save any work before you launch PetraMultiStart!!!

-Parameterisation
-----------------
-The test cases, the number of Clients the program starts in each test case, and the actions the program asks the 
-Clients to do, are set up in an XML file.
-* The XML file is specified with the '-testscript' command line argument. Usually this would be the file 'multistart.testing' 
-  found in this directory.
-  Have a look at the comments at the top of the file for an explanation of the parameterisation through that file.
-  
-  Note: Some tests have paramters that are passed on to the PetraClient, e.g. PartnerKey, LedgerNumber. Since they need to be
-        hard-coded in this file they relate to a specific DB. The ones that are found in this file are at the moment working
-        for the ZA DB and will need to be adapted to any other DB!
-  
-* The test case is specified with the '-testcase' command line argument. Example: 'FullClient_only2'.
-
-
-Usage
------
-1) Start PetraServerConsole.exe
-
-2) Start PetraMultiStart on the command line from the \delivery\bin folder.
-      Example command line:
-      PetraMultiStart.exe -C:C:\openpetraorg\trunk\csharp\ICT\Testing\exe\PetraMultiStart\app-sample.config -testscript:C:\openpetraorg\trunk\csharp\ICT\Testing\exe\PetraMultiStart\multistart.testing -testcase:FullClient_only2 -startclientid:0
-
-   Note: As PetraMultiStart starts Clients it asks them to log in as different users. Since the program cannot assume specific users as PetraServerConsole could be connected to any DB,
-         the program creates 40 test users with 'demo' user privileges in the DB that PetraServerConsole is connected to when the program is started. 
-         In case these users exist already, nothing 'bad' happens and the program continues.
